# # Pollard Rho is an integer factorization algorithm, which is quite fast for large numbers.
# # It is based on Floydâ€™s cycle-finding algorithm and on the observation that two numbers x and y are
# # congruent modulo p with probability 0.5 after 1.177\sqrt{p} numbers have been randomly chosen.
# This version of the code is a fully optimized and modified version of the code to be found here:
